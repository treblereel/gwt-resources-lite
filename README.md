# gwt-resources-lite

This project allows to wrap resources (js, txt, css or images) into generated Java classes, that can later be obtained on the client side. Unlike the GWT2 resources module, gwt-resources-lite supports very limited scope of features (no less/gss optimisation, i18n, server-side resources) and has no deps on gwt2.
