# gwt-resources-lite

This project provides ability to wrap our resources (js, txt, css or images) into generated java classes, so it can be obtained on the client side. Unlike GWT2 resources module, it supports very limited scope of features (no less/gss optimisation, i18n, server-side resources) and has no deps on gwt2.
