# gwt-resources-lite

This project provides ability to wrap resources (js, txt, css or images) into generated java classes, so then it can be obtained on the client side. Unlike GWT2 resources module, gwt-resources-lite supports very limited scope of features (no less/gss optimisation, i18n, server-side resources) and has no deps on gwt2.
